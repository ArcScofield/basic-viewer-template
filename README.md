basic-viewer-template
=====================

The Basic Viewer is a configurable template that displays a web map from ArcGIS.com along with several optional tools.  This
template is a great choice for those of you who are looking to provide a focused experience to your end users but would 
still like to include some flexibility in terms of interacting with the application and the layers contained within the 
web map.
